# Mars-Rover
- A rover is to be sent on Mars to study the surface of the planet such as soil sampling and examining the land more closely
- The topographical 3D map of the surface of the planet is provided in the form of a matrix where each row and column value represents the site location and each matrix value represents the elevation of the planet at that site location
- The rover cannot climb up or down a surface that is steeper than a particular threshold value (elevation difference)
- The aim of this project is to guide the rover safely from a landing site to several destination sites
- Algorithms like BFS (Breadth First Search), UCS (Uniform Cost Search), A* search are implemented on the topographical map (graph)
- The result is, a shortest safe path from source to various destinations
- Read the project_description.pdf file for details such as path costs, format of input file, etc.
- Technologies used:
  - Artificial Intelligence
  - Language: Python
  - IDE: PyCharm
